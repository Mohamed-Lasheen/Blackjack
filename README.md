# Blackjack Game
#### Project Description:
Blackjack is a popular cards game where the players have to collect cards with the sum of their values being 21 in order to win, if they get more than that then they automatically lose, if nobody got 21 then the person with the highest sum while also less than 21 wins.

The game has three players and one bot, any of the three players has the option to keep drawing cards or stop, however the player cannot draw anymore cards once they reached a score of 21 or higher. The bot keeps drawing cards on their own until they win or lose.
